      <h2>Naming rules (so The ZAO stops getting eclipsed)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Say "The ZAO" first.</strong> In any external comm - to
          partners, on decks, on pamphlets, in group names - The ZAO is the lead
          brand. ZABAL is not the headline.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ZABAL is an incubated project.</strong> Use it for the
          builder engagement (ZABAL Games) and the toolstack the team builds
          with. It does not stand in for The ZAO as the umbrella, and it is
          never the marquee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>$ZABAL the token is fine as-is.</strong> It is a deployed
          on-chain community token on Base. A piece inside the network, not the
          umbrella.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Partners get "community partnership," not "project under The ZAO."
          </strong>{" "}
          COC Concertz and similar are partnerships with equal billing. Respect
          their ownership.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Incubated vs partnership is the key distinction.</strong>{" "}
          Incubated = ZAO-owned with cofounders (WaveWarZ, ZAO Festivals, ZABAL
          / ZABAL Games). Partnership = beside The ZAO (COC). Do not blur them.
        </li>
      </ol>
